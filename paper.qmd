abstract: |
 In a context of growing concern for replicability, transparency, and access to science, in the present paper we aim to describe and analyze the factors associated to practices, beliefs and knowledge of open science in the social sciences' academic community in Chile. We conducted an exploratory mixed-method design, starting with a qualitative study where we performed a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 14 academics. Next, for the quantitative study we analyzed data from an online survey (N=98) completed by social scientists in Chile. The questionnaire addressed issues about Open Science, transparent design, open data, and reproducible research. Overall, both studies pointed to low levels of knowledge and practices related to open science. In addition, despite generally positive attitudes, we noted particular concerns regarding the applicability of open science principles in social research in Chile, such as the limitations of opening qualitative research, the possible contradiction between open science demands and the imperatives of academic productivity, and fear of other's researchers taking advantage of open information.

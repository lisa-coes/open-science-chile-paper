# Introduction

In recent years, academia has faced significant challenges and barriers regarding openness, which can be broadly categorized into two main areas. The first concerns the so-called *replication crisis* [@baker_1500_2016; @nosek_promoting_2015; @peng_reproducibility_2015], characterized by difficulties in replicating research findings due to insufficient transparency in research processes. This lack of transparency has led to substantial variations in results, even when studies use identical data [@breznau_does_2021]. Consequently, many published findings have failed to be replicated, and instances of data fabrication or falsification have been reported in the pursuit of publication in high-impact journals [@chopik_relationship_2020]. The second challenging area relates to access. Many academic communities have pushed back against the high costs and restrictive business models imposed by publishing houses, which limit access to scientific research outputs. Universities often pay substantial subscription fees to access the work of their own researchers, while the general public must pay again to access research funded by their taxes. Notably, some prestigious universities, such as UCLA, have responded by canceling subscriptions to publishers like Elsevier, prompting negotiations that have led to agreements promoting open-access practices. 

The barriers to transparency and access are symptoms of a "publish or perish" academic culture. Such culture has been related to a tendency to force results (p-hacking), even going as far as manipulating and falsifying data to confirm proposed hypotheses [@head_extent_2015] as well as establishing ad hoc hypotheses after knowing the results of a study (so called HARKing - Hypothesis After Results are Known) [@hollenbeck_harking_2017; @kerr_harking_1998]. As a result, the main audience for science ultimately becomes the editors of high-impact journals, while other audiences -- such as civil society, decision-makers and citizens --- are left out. In order to address these issues, the open science movement has emerged as a response to the challenges of replicability, transparency, and access in science. Open science encompasses a set of practices that promote openness and collaboration throughout the research process, from the initial design of studies to the sharing of data and findings. It aims to make scientific research more accessible, transparent, and reproducible, thereby enhancing the credibility and reliability of scientific knowledge.

The open science movement has gained momentum in recent years, with various initiatives and policies being implemented to promote transparency and accessibility in research. These efforts have been particularly prominent in the natural sciences, where open data repositories, preprint servers, and collaborative platforms have become increasingly common. However, the adoption of open science practices has been slower in the social sciences, where concerns about privacy, ethics, and the complexities of qualitative research have posed challenges to openness [@boulton_open_2018; @miller_open_2019]. However, like many others developments in science, the open science movement has arrived slowly to Latin America, especially in social sciences. Although there have been some initiatives in recent years, most of them are driven mainly by the natural sciences.  

In Chile, the open science movement has been gaining traction, with various initiatives and policies being implemented to promote transparency and accessibility in research. However, the adoption of open science practices in the social sciences has been slower compared to the natural sciences. This is due to several factors, including concerns about privacy, ethics, and the complexities of qualitative research [@boulton_open_2018; @miller_open_2019]. Based on this diagnosis, we aimed to identify the knowledge, attitudes and practices of open science among social science academics in Chile. From this analysis, we expect to generate debate and proposal for both academic work and science policies.

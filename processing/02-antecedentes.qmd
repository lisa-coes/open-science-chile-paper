# Background

## a) Open science in the social sciences 

In the social sciences, the implementation of open science practices has posed specific challenges and opportunities, given the types of data handled, the ethical commitments to participant confidentiality, and the interpretive methodologies characteristic of some subdisciplines. Initiatives such as the Open Science Framework (OSF), Dataverse, and the European Open Science Cloud have contributed to facilitating the necessary technical infrastructure, but challenges related to academic incentives, technical capabilities, and regulatory frameworks remain. 

The current state of open science in social science research is heterogeneous, both across disciplines and regions. Several empirical studies have documented a growing awareness of the importance of openness, albeit with varying degrees of effective implementation. For example, colombo_sowing_2024 found that while social science researchers recognize the value of data sharing, institutional and cultural barriers limit its practice. More recently, @ferguson_survey_2023 analyzed over 3,000 articles in the social sciences and reported low but increasing rates of preregistration and data availability. Similarly, @polonen_open_2022 highlights that although open access publishing is on the rise in the social sciences, uptake is uneven and often hindered by funding and policy gaps. Studies such as @ferguson_survey_2023 and @fecher_open_2014 emphasize that researchers’ attitudes toward open science are generally positive, but practical adoption is constrained by concerns over data misuse, lack of recognition, and insufficient training. Furthermore, @basak_open_2023 and @campbell_openscience_2023 point out that the development of discipline-specific guidelines and support networks is crucial for advancing open science in the social sciences, especially in areas involving sensitive or qualitative data.

## b) Main components of open science in the research process

The open science movement is structured around several core components that collectively aim to enhance the transparency, accessibility, and reliability of scientific research. In the context of the social sciences, these components—transparent design, open data, reproducible analysis, and open publications—form the foundation for fostering a more collaborative and trustworthy research environment. Each element addresses specific challenges and opportunities, from ensuring that research methodologies are openly documented, to making data and analytical procedures accessible for verification and reuse, and promoting the dissemination of findings through open access channels. Together, these pillars support the advancement of open science practices and help address the unique ethical, technical, and cultural considerations present in social science research.

**Transparent design**

Transparency in research design constitutes one of the fundamental pillars of open science, proposing that methodological decisions made in research be accessible, justified, and documented from the initial stages of the scientific process. This practice is embodied in strategies such as pre-registration of hypotheses, open registration of protocols, and the publication of analysis plans prior to data collection. As recent research highlights [@banks_answers_2019; @nosek_preregistration_2019], transparency in design not only strengthens the credibility of the knowledge produced but also acts as a deterrent to questionable research practices. However, the social sciences face particular challenges in this area, especially in qualitative or emerging approaches, where designs are adaptive and context-sensitive.

**Open data**

Open access to research data—also known as data sharing—has been one of the most visible components of the open science agenda. Its potential lies in enabling independent verification of results, the reuse of databases in new research, and the strengthening of a culture of scientific collaboration. In the social sciences, however, data sharing entails dealing with a tension between openness and protecting the confidentiality of participants, given that the data are often sensitive or identifiable. Despite the ethical challenges, studies such as those by @dallmeier-tiessen_highlights_2011 show a growing appreciation among researchers for the value of data sharing to increase transparency and collaboration. Furthermore, principles such as FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) are being incorporated into institutional policies and training programs, although challenges remain related to infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and training for responsible and effective data management.

**Reproducible analysis**

Reproducibility refers to the ability to exactly replicate the results of a study using the same data and code used in the original analysis. This principle has been central to the discussion about the "reproducibility crisis" that has affected multiple disciplines, including the social sciences. Research such as that by @baker_1500_2016 and @hail_reproducibility_2020 has documented widespread concerns about the lack of reproducibility, identifying causes such as lack of access to code scripts, opacity in the presentation of results, and the use of weak statistical procedures. In response, the use of platforms such as GitHub, OSF, or Dataverse has been promoted, where researchers can host their codes and workflows. However, as @knudtson_survey_2019 point out, achieving reproducible social science requires not only technical infrastructure but also a transformation in the cultural norms of the academic community that values reproducibility as a criterion of scientific quality.

**Open publications**

Open access to scientific publications has been one of the most established dimensions of open science, with multiple policies and mandates from funding agencies requiring the public availability of research results. In the context of the social sciences, although numerous institutional repositories and open access journals exist, barriers related to publication costs (article processing charges) and the editorial prestige associated with fee-paying journals still prevail. @narayan_scholarly_2018 shows that there is a significant gap between the stated knowledge about open access and its effective implementation, particularly with regard to the different existing models (green, gold, hybrid). Likewise, recent studies in Latin America, show a high level of favorable disposition toward open access, but also a lack of institutional incentives and technical support mechanisms to facilitate its widespread adoption [@pardomartinez_knowledge_2018].

## c) Antecedents of open science policies in Chile

In Chile, the development of open science policies has gained momentum in recent years, reflecting global trends and responding to local needs for greater transparency and collaboration in research. The first significant step was the adoption of open access mandates by major research funding agencies, such as the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), which since 2013 has required that publications resulting from publicly funded projects be deposited in institutional or national repositories.

In 2021, ANID published the "National Policy for Open Science," establishing guidelines to promote open access to publications, data, and other research outputs. This policy emphasizes the importance of data management plans, the use of interoperable repositories, and the adoption of FAIR principles. Additionally, the policy encourages the development of training programs and support structures to facilitate the transition toward open science practices.

A notable initiative in this context is the INES Ciencia Abierta program, launched by ANID in 2020 to strengthen institutional capacities for open science. Through competitive funding, the INES Ciencia Abierta projects support universities and research centers in developing infrastructure, policies, and training for open access, data management, and reproducibility. These projects have enabled the creation and enhancement of institutional repositories, the implementation of data stewardship services, and the promotion of open science culture within participating institutions. The program also fosters collaboration and knowledge exchange among institutions, contributing to the consolidation of a national open science ecosystem.

Several universities and research centers in Chile have also implemented their own open access and data sharing policies, creating institutional repositories and providing guidance for researchers. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including the need for greater awareness, technical infrastructure, and clear regulatory frameworks to address issues such as data privacy and intellectual property.  Overall, the Chilean experience demonstrates a growing institutional commitment to open science, with ongoing efforts to align national practices with international standards and to foster a culture of openness and collaboration in the scientific community.

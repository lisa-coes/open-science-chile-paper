# Background

a) Revisión ciencia abierta en general (Kevin, práctica)

Open science has emerged as one of the most significant developments in the contemporary transformation of scientific practice, proposing a set of practices aimed at increasing the transparency, accessibility, collaboration, and reproducibility of scientific knowledge [@fecher_open_2014]. This paradigm promotes open access to publications, data, methods, and codes, as well as open peer review, in an effort to democratize the production and circulation of knowledge. In response to crises of reproducibility and credibility in various disciplines, open science represents not only a technical agenda but also a normative one, challenging traditional models of scientific organization and its connection with society [@bezjak_open_2018] (UNESCO, 2021). Thus, beyond institutional policies, open science implies a cultural shift in the global scientific community.

In the social sciences, the implementation of open science practices has posed specific challenges and opportunities, given the types of data handled, the ethical commitments to participant confidentiality, and the interpretive methodologies characteristic of some subdisciplines. Although initially lagging behind the natural sciences, in the last decade the social sciences have experienced increasing adoption of data repositories, pre-registration of studies, and publication of analytical codes, especially in areas such as psychology, experimental economics, and quantitative sociology [@nosek_preregistration_2018; @hardwicke_empirical_2020]. At the same time, debates have emerged about how to adapt open science practices to qualitative and collaborative methods, highlighting tensions between openness and the protection of situated or sensitive knowledge [@mauthner_open_2013].

The current state of open science in social science research is heterogeneous, both across disciplines and regions. Several empirical studies have documented a growing awareness of the importance of openness, albeit with varying degrees of effective implementation. For example, @vandeneynden_sowing_2014 found that while social science researchers recognize the value of data sharing, institutional and cultural barriers limit its practice. More recently, @christensen_study_2019 analyzed over 3,000 articles in the social sciences and reported low but increasing rates of preregistration and data availability. Initiatives such as the Open Science Framework (OSF), Dataverse, and the European Open Science Cloud have contributed to facilitating the necessary technical infrastructure, but challenges related to academic incentives, technical capabilities, and regulatory frameworks remain.

**Transparent design**

Transparency in research design constitutes one of the fundamental pillars of open science, proposing that methodological decisions made in research be accessible, justified, and documented from the initial stages of the scientific process. This practice is embodied in strategies such as pre-registration of hypotheses, open registration of protocols, and the publication of analysis plans prior to data collection. As recent research highlights [@banks_answers_2019; @nosek_preregistration_2019], transparency in design not only strengthens the credibility of the knowledge produced but also acts as a deterrent to questionable research practices. However, the social sciences face particular challenges in this area, especially in qualitative or emerging approaches, where designs are adaptive and context-sensitive.

**Open data**

Open access to research data—also known as data sharing—has been one of the most visible components of the open science agenda. Its potential lies in enabling independent verification of results, the reuse of databases in new research, and the strengthening of a culture of scientific collaboration. In the social sciences, however, data sharing entails dealing with a tension between openness and protecting the confidentiality of participants, given that the data are often sensitive or identifiable. Despite the ethical challenges, studies such as those by @dallmeier-tiessen_highlights_2011 show a growing appreciation among researchers for the value of data sharing to increase transparency and collaboration. Furthermore, principles such as FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) are being incorporated into institutional policies and training programs, although challenges remain related to infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and training for responsible and effective data management.

**Reproducible analysis**

Reproducibility refers to the ability to exactly replicate the results of a study using the same data and code used in the original analysis. This principle has been central to the discussion about the "reproducibility crisis" that has affected multiple disciplines, including the social sciences. Research such as that by @baker_1500_2016 and @hail_reproducibility_2020 has documented widespread concerns about the lack of reproducibility, identifying causes such as lack of access to code scripts, opacity in the presentation of results, and the use of weak statistical procedures. In response, the use of platforms such as GitHub, OSF, or Dataverse has been promoted, where researchers can host their codes and workflows. However, as @knudtson_survey_2019 point out, achieving reproducible social science requires not only technical infrastructure but also a transformation in the cultural norms of the academic community that values reproducibility as a criterion of scientific quality.

**Open publications**

Open access to scientific publications has been one of the most established dimensions of open science, with multiple policies and mandates from funding agencies requiring the public availability of research results. In the context of the social sciences, although numerous institutional repositories and open access journals exist, barriers related to publication costs (article processing charges) and the editorial prestige associated with fee-paying journals still prevail. @narayan_scholarly_2018 shows that there is a significant gap between the stated knowledge about open access and its effective implementation, particularly with regard to the different existing models (green, gold, hybrid). Likewise, recent studies in Latin America, show a high level of favorable disposition toward open access, but also a lack of institutional incentives and technical support mechanisms to facilitate its widespread adoption [@pardomartinez_knowledge_2018].
